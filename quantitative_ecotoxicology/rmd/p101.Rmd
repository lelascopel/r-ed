This is example 3.6 on page 101 of [Quantitative Ecotoxicology](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439835647) - reproduced with R. This example is about adsorption and how to fit an adsorption model to data.

Get the data from [here](https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/p101.csv) and read it into R:

```{r message=FALSE}
require(RCurl)
url <- getURL("https://raw.github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology/data/p101.csv")
ZINC <- read.table(text = url, header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```
```{r}
head(ZINC)
```

So we have a data.frame with two columns,
where N = amount adsorbed (mmol) per unit mass (g) and  C = equilibrium concentration in the aqueous phase (mmol/ml).

We want fit a Langmuir Model (Equation 3.28 in the book) to this data. 

The three methods described are:

* Nonlinear Regression
* linear transformation
* linear transformation with weighting



#### Nonlinear Regression
```{r}
mod_nls <- nls(N ~ (K*C*M)/(1+K*C), data = ZINC, 
           start = list(K = 3, M = 9), lower = 0, 
           algorithm = 'port')
```
This fits the model 

$$ N = \frac{KCM}{1+KC} $$ 

to the data. 

We supplied some starting values and specified the lower bonds for K and M as 0 (bonds can only be used with the port algorithm).

This gives us the estimates for K and M as:
```{r}
summary(mod_nls)
```

* $K = 2.097 \pm 0.188$
* $M = 9.899 \pm 0.521$

The t and p-values of this output are not of interest for us (tests if the parameters deviate from 0).

We can plot the raw data and the model easily using the predict-function:
```{r plot-nls}
plot(ZINC$C, ZINC$N, xlab = 'C', ylab = 'N')
# generate C-values to predict
x_n <- seq(min(ZINC$C), max(ZINC$C), length.out=200)
# add predicts to plot
lines(x_n, predict(mod_nls, newdata = data.frame(C = x_n)))
```



#### Linear model of transformation
We use were the reciprocal transformation, so C/N versus C.
First we create a the transformed y-variable:
```{r}
ZINC$Y <- ZINC$C / ZINC$N
```

Fitting a linear model to this data is done with lm():
```{r plot-lm}
mod_lm <- lm(Y ~ C, data = ZINC)
plot(ZINC$C, ZINC$Y, ylab = 'C/N', xlab = 'C')
abline(mod_lm)
summary(mod_lm)
```
We get from this K and M as:

* $K = \frac{slope}{intercept} = \frac{0.114}{0.043} = 2.62$
* $M = \frac{1}{slope} = \frac{1}{0.114} = 8.77$

The R^2 is 0.966.


#### Linear model of transformation with weights
Newman used N^4 / C^2 weighting. So first we need to calculate the weights:
```{r}
ZINC$WGT = ZINC$N^4 / ZINC$C^2
```

And fit the linear model with weighting:
```{r}
mod_wgt <- lm(Y ~ C, data = ZINC, weights = ZINC$WGT)
summary(mod_wgt)
```
The R^2 is slightly higher: 0.977.

The result for K is:
```{r}
coef(mod_wgt)[2] / coef(mod_wgt)[1]
```

and for M:
```{r}
1 / coef(mod_wgt)[2]
```

#### Are the models appropiate?

We can inspect the residuals of both models:


```{r plot-resid, out.width="500px", fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
# lm
plot(mod_lm, which = 1, main='linear model without weights')
# nls
plot(fitted(mod_nls), residuals(mod_nls), xlab = 'fitted', ylab = 'Residuals', main = 'nonlinear regression')
abline(h = 0, lty = 'dotted')
```

The linear model clearly shows an arc-pattern in the residuals - so the data may not follow a linear relationship.
The nonlinear model performs better.



Once again we reproduced the same results as in the book using R :)
Code and data are available on my [github-repo](https://github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/tree/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology) under file name 'p101'.
