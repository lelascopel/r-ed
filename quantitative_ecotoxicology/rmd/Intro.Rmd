There is a fresh book about [Quantitative Ecotoxicology](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439835647):
> Newman, Michael C. (2012). Quantitative Ecotoxicology, Second Edition. CRC Press


Unfortunately all examples are written in SAS, to which I have no access (5.530€ for a licence of SAS Analytics Pro).

Since I am a poor student who likes R and ecotoxicology, I will try to reproduce the examples given in the book.


All code and data are available at my [github-repository](https://github.com/EDiLD/r-ed/tree/master/quantitative_ecotoxicology).
